ipysketch_lite docs
========================================

Simple sketching tool for Jupyter notebooks

What makes ipysketch_lite different is non use of any third party widget code.
It is a simple sketching tool that uses the canvas element to draw on.
After drawing a sketch you can use it directly in your notebook as an image.
When changes are made to the sketch, the image is updated automatically.
