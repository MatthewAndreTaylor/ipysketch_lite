Quickstart 🚀
-----------------

Start drawing a quick sketch in your notebook like this

.. code-block:: python

   from ipysketch_lite import Sketch
   
   sketch = Sketch()

Then add a new cell to retrieve the sketch data in python

.. code-block:: python

   sketch.data # Sketch image data as a base64 encoded string
   sketch.image # PIL Image of the sketch

Sketch data gets updated in cells after the sketch is modified.
This means you can edit your sketch and get the new updated outputs
